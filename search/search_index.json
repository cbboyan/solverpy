All solvers support T and additional resource limits might be available depending on the solver. Multiple resource limits can be used (separated by - , like T10-R50000 ). The limit string must, however, always start with T . Then call the solve method: result = cvc5 . solve ( \"myproblem.smt2\" , \"--enum-inst\" ) The first argument is the problem filename, the second is the solver-dependent strategy description (typically command line options as a string). The result is a Python dict with results and statistics. The keys and values are solver-specific. Nevertheless, the result always contains keys status (with the value of type str ) and runtime (type float ). \ud83d\udca1 Call cvc5.run(p,s) instead of cvc5.solve(p,s) to get the raw solver output without any processing. \ud83d\udca1 Call cvc5.command(p,s) to output the shell command that is going to be executed to launch the solver. Parallel benchmark evaluation To evaluate a set of strategies on a set of benchmark problems, you just need to provide your experiment description as a Python dict and launch the experiments. from solverpy.benchmark import setups mysetup = ... setups . launch ( mysetup ) The experiment setup ( mysetup ) must have specific keys. The module solverpy.benchmark.setups contains methods to fill in the required keys and values. You must specify at least the following: key type description cores int number of CPU cores to use for parallel evaluation sidlist [str] list of strategies to evaluate bidlist [str] list of problems to evaluate on limit str the resource limit for a single solver run Strategies and strategy id's Strategies are stored in files in the directory solverpy_db/strats which must exist in the current working directory (the directory is adjustable by the SOLVERPY_DB environment variable). The filename of each strategy is used to reference the strategy in sidlist and it is called the strategy id ( sid ). Hence, for every sid in sidlist in mysetup , there must be the file solverpy_db/strats/sid in the current working directory. This file contains the strategy definition (typically command line options) to pass to the solver.solve method. Problems and benchmark id's Benchmark problem sets are represented by benchark id's ( bid ). The benchmark id is a file path relative to the current working directory (adjustable by the SOLVERPY_BENCHMARKS environment variable) pointing either to a file or to a directory. If the path leads to a: directory : Then every regular file directly in this directory is considered a benchmark problem. Directories and hidden files are ignored and no recursive search is performed. This variant is useful when you have a set of problem files, all in one directory. file : Then the file consists of lines containing paths to corresponding problem files. The paths are relative to the directory of the bid file. For example, if the bid is myproblems/subset1 and this file contains (among others) the line category1/problem23.smt2 then the problem must be placed in myproblems/category1/problem23.smt2 (because the directory of the bid file is myproblems ). This variant is useful when your benchmarks are structured in subdirectories and you don't want to merge them into one directory. Experiments example Suppose you have some SMT problems in the directory myproblems and that you want to evaluate your cvc5 strategies buzzard , sparrow , and chickadee , which you have placed in the directory solverpy_db/strats . You can download the archive with files for this example here . You proceed as follows.

Hint: Options are slightly more described here . Then you specify that you want to use cvc5 and that you wish to launch an evaluation. These methods update mysetup and fill in some keys required by setups.launch() . setups . cvc5 ( mysetup ) setups . evaluation ( mysetup ) Finally, you launch the experiments. setups . launch ( mysetup ) You will see the progress of the experiments on the screen.

One per line, easy to grep and cat . status Statuses of all problems by each strategy for each bid . Problem name and status at one line, TAB separated. Easy to cut . log Console log for each solverpy experiment run. outputs Raw solver output files for each solver run (only if selected). Now run the script again and notice that it finished much faster. It is because the cached results were reused and no solvers were actually launched.

In SolverPy, this collection must be stored in a file and placed inside the strats database directory, by default solverpy_db/strats (see the db module). The file name inside the strats directory is called the strategy id ( sid ). The content of the file is a solver-specific strategy definition that is passed to the Solver.solve method. Example For E Prover, you can have the file solverpy_db/strats/auto with the following content: --auto-schedule Then --auto-schedule is the strategy definition while auto is its strategy id. You can now use auto in sidlist to reference the strategy in experiment setup Setup with E Prover. Note As opposed to a benchmark identifier bid , a strategy identifier sid can not contain / characters. Parametric Strategies Some solvers support parametric strategies with variable slots in the strategy definition. The syntax for variable slots is as follows: @@@ var : value @@@ where var is the variable name and value is its default value. Note Names var and value can not contain characters @ , : , or space. The value of a variable can be overridden in the strategy identifier using the following format: sid@var1=value1:var2=value2 Here sid still refers to the base strategy id, while var1=value1 and var2=value2 are different variable assignments. Any number of : -separated variable assignments can be provided in the strategy id. Example For E Prover, you can have a parametric strategy gen with the following definition: --enigmatic-gen-threshold=@@@ thrgen : 0.1 @@@ Then the strategy id (sid) gen@thrgen=0.5 results in the following strategy definition: --enigmatic-gen-threshold=0.5 See Also See the Sid solver plugin that automatically translates strategy ids to strategy definitions.

All solvers support T and additional resource limits might be available depending on the solver. Multiple resource limits can be used (separated by - , like T10-R50000 ). The limit string must, however, always start with T . Then call the solve method: result = cvc5 . solve ( \"myproblem.smt2\" , \"--enum-inst\" ) The first argument is the problem filename, the second is the solver-dependent strategy description (typically command line options as a string). The result is a Python dict with results and statistics. The keys and values are solver-specific. Nevertheless, the result always contains keys status (with the value of type str ) and runtime (type float ). Hint: Call cvc5.run(p,s) instead of cvc5.solve(p,s) to get the raw solver output without any processing.
